- This is a project I worked collaboratively with other members of the computer vision at The University of Bauhaus. We tried to build a stereo rig from scratch using Baumer camera and reconstruct 3D point cloud in the real-time. Due to the real-time constraint of the project, every stages of the pipeline must be implemented in OpenCL.

- My main responsibilities in this project is: stereo camera calibration, image rectification, and stereo dense matching.
