The data-set contains 3D scans of non-rigid human subjects captured at 60 fps. There are around 40.000 raw and aligned meshes. Alignment here means that vertices of a template mesh at a particular frame is registered with the corresponding vertices at the next frame.

# [Caesar dataset](http://store.sae.org/caesar/)

-  The original Caesar data-set contains 3D scan meshes of 2,400 U.S. & Canadian and 2,000 European civilians, half of which are female. Because the subjects were scanned while wearing underclothes, most of the resulting meshes have noise have crotch and armpit area. Each mesh also come with 72 body landmarks as shown in the below figure.

- The Maxplank institute registered the origin Caesar meshes with a template triangle mesh of 6890 vertices and published their resulting meshes [this address](http://humanshape.mpi-inf.mpg.de/). There is no gender attached with mesh instances in their published dataset.

# [Human3.6M](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/description.php)
- Objective: complement existing human motion capture datasets.
- In general, the data-set contains 3.6 million different human poses of 11 professional actors (6 male and 5 female) taken from 4 digital cameras arranged as in the below figure.

- Details: the dataset come with the following data
  - 3D pose is given with respect to a skeleton.
  - time-of-flight data
  - 3D scanning meshes of actors
